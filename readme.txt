Preserve some aspects of the old MMPU add on for PMPro 3.0+.

== Description ==

This Add On allows users to purchase multiple membership levels in a single checkout when using onsite Stripe or Braintree payment fields.

Note that this functionality is not going to be supported indefinitely and will not work with most PMPro Add Ons that alter checkout behavior.
We are offering this MMPU (Legacy) plugin as an intermediate option for sites to upgrade to 3.0 and maintain their current multiple levels checkout experience.

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you have Paid Memberships Pro v3.0+ installed and activated.
1. Upload the `pmpro-mmpu-legacy` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
